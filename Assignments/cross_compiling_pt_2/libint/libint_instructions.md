# Part 1: Integer Arithmetic Library in C
### Implement basic arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

*These functions should only handle INT data types.*

* Ensure that each function is implemented in its own source file (e.g., `add_int.c`, `subtract_int.c`, etc.).

* Include a header file (`int_arithmetic.h`) that declares these functions.

* Compile these source files into object files and then create a static library named `libintarithmetic.a.`
